# A Socialist Reads Atlas Shrugged

Although I am no longer creating new episodes for this podcast, it remains available on major podcast platforms. It's very exciting that since it's debut in early 2023, the podcast has received over 9,000 downloads. Thank you all who have listened and feel free to fill out the [contact form](/contact) on this website with any questions or comments about *A Socialist Reads Atlas Shrugged*.

The original inspiration for this podcast came from how I noticed that *Atlas Shrugged* operates as a type of ur-text for a lot of Republican Party policies and conservative ideology. Many leftists dismiss the book, and Ayn Rand in general, as unworthy of attention due to Rand's eccentricities and the melodrama of her prose style. However, many people have read *Atlas Shrugged* and find great value in its ideas. I wanted to explore the arguments in the book and offer a response that would help people to move beyond the caricature of socialism presented in it.
