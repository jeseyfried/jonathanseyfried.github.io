## Today’s Document 
- Subject: Violant recommends Bernardo Maloll for an ecclesiastical post
- Date: December 27, 1387
- Day of the Week: Wednesday
- Archival Reference Number: ACA CR R1822 f118r
- [Link to PARES](https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/show/4801318)
- Place: Girona
- Sender: Violant, Duchess of Girona
- Recipient: [Juan Fernández de Heredia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Heredia), Master of Rhodes, head of the Hospitallers

## Historical Thinking Notes
- Sourcing: written by the duchess one day after Joan’s letter; purpose is to support a job candidate for an ecclesiastical post; Violant adds no new information in this letter and it’s possible that its actual composition is not hers, that she told the scribes to simply copy Joan’s letter and send it under her name; her connections to French authorities augment her influence with the Avignon papacy, led by a pope, Clement VII (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipope_Clement_VII) born and educated in France. 

- Contextualization: Western Schism of 1378, Pere attempted neutrality and Joan sided with Avignon; Violant also favored Avignon due to her French background; the monasteries in the letter are in Catalonia (Santa Creus) and Aragon (Santa Fe is near Zaragoza); Hospitallers have a lot of clout in the Mediterranean; 

- Corroboration: mentions Joan’s letter to the pope; language follows closely to Joan’s letter; corroborates Maloll’s worthiness for the new post 

- Close-Reading: we can see here how secular elites deploy honorifics and the language used to indicate competence; the word choices mention Joan, ‘el senyor duch nostro senyor e marido’ in the standard way ‘the lord duke our [my] lord and husband’ but this should not be read as submissive – it’s just his titles  

## What is this document doing?
- This document deploys Violant’s authority in support for Maloll, places herself as a follow-up supplement to Joan’s support 
- This document further iterates the presumption that secular authorities influence ecclesiastical appointments in the Crown of Aragon  

## Questions
- Did Violant compose this letter or direct the scribe to compose a copy of Joan’s letter to the Master of Rhodes?  
- How did Violant’s background as a member of the royal family of France affect her clout with the Avignon Pope Clement VII and the Master of Rhodes? 
- Did Violant frequently supplement Joan’s recommendation letters with follow-up letters of her own or was this not so frequent? 
- All the questions about Joan’s letter from Episode 2.
