The silence in Violant's register of letters hides what must have been a very active period as King Pere the Ceremonious lay dying. To understand Violant's role in the logistics of succession, it helps to introduce a few additional figures, such as Sibilla de Fortià and Joan's brother Martí.

With a bunch of Joan's letters just ahead, today's document returns to Violant and introduces into the podcast another type of record in the Archive of the Crown of Aragon, the registers of the finances of the royal family. These treasury records, known as the Patrimonio Real, the Royal Patriomony, offer tantalizing glimpses into the lives of Joan and Violant.

## Additional Notes
- Calm before the storm
- Violant's letters stop and, in R1819, the last one in Girona is on 3rd of January
- Joan had initially supported Sibilla as a concubine but when Pere decided to marry her, it turned into a threat, as a young son could be a pretender to the throne behind a rebellion
- Pere and Sibilla picked a fight by trying to get a high-born lady to become part of Siblla's household. When the lady refused, Joan and Violant protected her. In an effort to diffuse the situation, Joan went to see his father. Pere refused him entry to Barcelona and Joan waited outside in the suburb of Martorell for all of June and July 1386.
- Sibilla de Fortià had fled to her brother's castle, St. Martí sa Roca in Catalonia, sometime around December 22nd or maybe even on Christmas
- Martí went to that castle and waited outside it
